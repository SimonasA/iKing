iKing
=====

Visided London just recently. One stop was @cmdrconf to learn some Swift programming and another was historical London palace.

As my picture near royal residence was lacking of something (even though I was smiling), i tried Swift for the first time in action during London-nights.

It takes ones photo, uses face-detection + magic AND... if a person standing near London palace is THE KING - it puts a crown on him. 

Check out how much the picture is improved now:
